## Bad Question

Link: https://stackoverflow.com/q/44315657

This question starts off with a typo in the beginning. The worst thing when asking professionals for assistance is to not proofread. It makes it less likely that someone would care to answer the question since it shows that the poster cares little of the subject.

The poster also rambles a bit in the beginning by saying that they are a newbie. No one cares and does not add anything to the subject at hand.

They post a quote from the article they are reading and bold the word instantiate. Then they ask about what that word means. A simple question asking “What does the word instantiate mean in Java?” would have sufficed. This is besides the fact that a simple Google search would have netted them the answer.

## Smart Question

This question starts off with giving context to the poster’s question right away. They saw that they could instantiate a class in C# and wondered if this was applicable to Java. The question is clear and concise in one sentence. This gives the people who help a much easier time to help since its a clear message.
