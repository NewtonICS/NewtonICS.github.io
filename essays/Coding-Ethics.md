##  Ethics and Its Relation to Software Engineering

Ethics can be a difficult topic to discuss in general. Ethic codes can vary depending on the country one lives in or even the household one grows up in. Having a written code of ethics that everyone can generally agree on is a solution to remedy this problem.

The code of ethics written down by ACM lists the rules and guidelines that would be in line with what most consider ethically correct. There are 4 sections in the list. Sections 1 through 3 are the most important parts though. Section 1 outlines the fundamental ethical principles. Section 2 addresses any additional, more specific considerations of professional responsibility while section 3 guides individuals who have a leadership role. These 3 sections give a thorough explanation of what is expected of people in computing.

## Section 1.3 Be honest and trustworthy

Misleading claims and falsifying data in science is strictly forbidden. In the world of computing, this is no different. Many companies face trouble nowadays with this ethic code and some even lost lawsuits due to it. Companies that span from Google with its targeted advertising to Reddit with their financial support from Tencent. However, at the forefront of this ongoing debacle is Facebook.

## Facebook and Privacy

There are options in every person’s profile settings that allow only Friends or Family to view your profile page. Most people under this assumption would assume that it means that absolutely no one else would be able to view your profile. However, this is clearly not the case with Facebook. Years have gone by with more and more allegations against Facebook about how they are selling their users’ information to other companies or people. Privacy on Facebook doesn’t truly exist.

## 2016 Election

Evidence of election fraud has spread all over the news about the past presidential election. Many investigations have shown some evidence of the fraud occurring. Other issues reared their heads out as well though. Evidence has shown that Russia meddled online disguised as Americans. Their purpose was to create internal conflict among Americans. The majority of the comments made by the Russian trolls contained false information. These comments were found all over Facebook.

## My Thoughts

Keeping any sort of text based forum completely clean of false information is a tough challenge. A large website such as Facebook with hundreds of millions of users is impossible to fully moderate. This is still unacceptable for a multi-billion dollar company. Following a code of ethics should be a companies number one priority. Facebook not taking actions to remove the false information should make them liable in some way.
