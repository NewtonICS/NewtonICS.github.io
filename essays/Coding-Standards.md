## Future-Proofing.

Code upkeep and maintenance can be a pain. Looking at unmaintained code with little to no comments is a programmer’s nightmare. Most modern IDEs should give its users notifications when there are errors in the code. However, this does not help the programmer write clean and organized code. Code organization needs to be a skill that is built up and becomes second nature over time.

## Looking Nice and Pretty.

Multiple coding standards exist for every single programming language. Generally, all of these aim to keep the code understandable when others look at it.

Using ESLint seems to be a great option when it comes to organization. It seems rather strict about spacing between the most mundane things like the space between the function’s parenthesis and the curly bracket. It may seem over the top, but writing clean code is essential for troubleshooting, upkeep, maintenance, etc.

## The Dreaded Checkmark.

I am positively certain that other students in the class take issue with the checkmark. Honestly, I understand why they would be. It is another aspect to be worried about during the WOD. I can imagine that they had just fixed a bug in their code and are ready to turn it in, but that checkmark is not showing for them. This consumes their already limited time to fix.

However, I see that it shows if the code is consistent and legible. Learning is much more important in the end. I have not had much issue fixing the checkmark anyways.
