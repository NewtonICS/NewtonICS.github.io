## Design Patterns and its Benefits.

Design patterns are reusable ways of solving different common problems. The design pattern is not a specific chunk of code, but a general template of the solution. This template can be used to design the code needed to solve the problem.

Having these design patterns help speed up development for software since these templates can be used for multiple problems. This means less time thinking about solving it and more  time actually coding instead.

The use of design patterns can improve readability of the code as well. Writing code that has many patterns and similarities can help reading and maintaining code much easier for new and old programmers on the team.

## Any Negatives?

Sticking to a single solution for many problems can result in inefficient solutions. Problems almost never only have a single solution. There are different ways to approach most problems. As an example, the design pattern solution could cost O(n) time when a better, more customized solution could cost O(1) instead. 

## My Implementations.

There are common sorts that many computer science majors remember and use. I personally remember 3 of them on hand for different cases.

I use bubble sort when I want to quickly sort a given array. I use this mainly because it is extremely easy to implement into code. I use bucket sort when I know the range of the numbers in an array of numbers. This is rather easy to implement in Java and Python. I use binary insertion sort if I have enough time to implement as it can take more time to make into code compared to bubble sort. However, the time it takes to sort should average at O(logn) which is plenty more efficient.
