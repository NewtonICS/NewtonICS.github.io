My experience with JavaScript was rocky at the start. My initial impression of JavaScript was that the language seemed less complex than Java, yet still very useful. I still have that sentiment, but my initial foray into programming with it was a rough start.

## Thrown into the unknown.

I had just been accepted by the University of Nebraska for a summer internship. The project was to track a bus using a Raspberry Pi with a 3G cellular module attached to it. I had thought that I would be in charge of the Raspberry Pi portion of the project. This would have been fine since I have worked on projects before with the Pi. However, I was tasked with programming part of the front end of the website. I was to use JavaScript for my section.

I had 1 week to really learn JavaScript and the API that the team leader had chosen to use. I had to teach myself all of these new concepts that I was not taught with Java. I ended up worrying for nothing in the end. The team leader gave me the task of parsing incoming data and placing that into more organized data that the web page can use to show the bus information. Nothing that really stretched my (then) current knowledge of programming.

## ICS 314 and my future in this class.

I hope to learn the ins and outs of JavaScript better in this class. My knowledge is all self taught, so I’m hoping to learn in a more organized fashion.

With ES 6, I have already learned that I should be using “let” instead of “var” which is important to keep data organized. I am glad that this class is keeping up-to-date with the latest programming standards for JavaScript. JavaScript is definitely part of the future for programming, so having it in Software Engineering is very helpful.

The “athletic” software engineering in class is good at letting the students (and teacher) whether they are confident enough in writing JavaScript code. I like the idea so far and look forward to new ones in this semester. I have passed the initial two so far and I feel like they helped me gauge what else I need to study to be capable at JavaScript.

## In Conclusion.

I think that my outlook on JavaScript will be positive once I have passed this class. I enjoy programming and see this class as only a benefit to that.
