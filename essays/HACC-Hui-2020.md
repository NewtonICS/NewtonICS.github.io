## What is HACC-Hui?

First, let's start with what HACC is. HACC stands for the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge. This code challenge attracts participants from all corners of the Hawaiian Islands. Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, participants would have a difficult time creating teams with no centralized way of communicating online. We wanted to create a way for all of the participants to find suitable teams online.

HACC-Hui was the solution to this problem. HACC-Hui is both a slackbot and meteor application. The goal was to create a way for the participants to create or join a team for HACC. HACC-Hui allows participants to find teams and other participants that best fit their needed skillsets.

## Functionality that I added

#### Milestone 1

I created the profile form during the first milestone. This profile form was for the particpants to fill out so they can show the other teams what skills they have to offer. The profile page contained fields to show the languages the participant knew, which challenges they wanted to participate in, as well as which skills they can provide. The participants can also add links to their GitHub, LinkedIn, and personal website (if applicable). These fields would allow the teams to view the participant's external efforts and achievements.

#### Milestone 2

I remember a client attended one of our bi-weekly online meetings. The client stated that many of the people who quit HACC end up simply not working on the challenge. These people do not really tell anybody that they are quitting. So creating a way for these people to quit officially would be better than having them simply cut off communication.

I created the deletion function for the application. The code below shows a bit of what I added into the functionality. The form would give the clients more information as to why the participant quit. These options can help the clients with future HACC events by trying to fix these reasons.

#### The Final Sprint

ListTeamsWidget had a bug that I had to fix. The desired skills and tools were not showing up correctly. I had to fix the bug by updating the functions to properly fetch the correct data.

## Teamwork Made the Dream Work

My team of 5 communicated well and worked hard. Our team name was Level Up Team A. The other group members were Angeli Amascual, Christine Uehara, Justin Wong, and Nadine Alcantara. All of my teammates communicated actively in our group chat and contributed significantly for their respective issue. Each and every one of them were excellent to work with and I would absolutley work together with them again.

We did not assign anyone in particular as a leader. We all chose issues out of the pile were we assigned and worked on our own initially. Whenever anyone ran into a roadblock, they asked the other groupmembers for assistance. All of us messaged the group chat questions about the issues at least once each, and all of us have answered each one of the questions multiple times.
