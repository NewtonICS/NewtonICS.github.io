## Before the class began...
Learning how to code in ICS 111 and 211 were essential experiences into thinking like a Computer Scientist. They gave general knowledge about coding. The classes helped cement the ability to code. They ingrained habits into my coding. However, these classes did not teach how to code real world situations.

## Using GitHub
I had not used GitHub much before this class. I knew that it was used in the professional spaces. I had heard about its use for version control but not much else.

When I began using GitHub for ICS 314, I understood why professionals used this software. Branching made testing and bug fixing a whole lot simpler. No need to worry about breaking your code completely. Pulling changes that others have made onto your computer to try out.

I believe that learning my way around GitHub will be extremely beneficial in the long run. Using it in the final project was a blessing. Keeping the issue branches separated from the master branch sped up bug fixing and feature implementations. I hope to use the knowledge that I gained from this in future projects or professions.

## Coding Standards
Using IntelliJ was a first for me. In my previous classes, we primarily stuck to Eclipse as our only IDE. I am unsure of what coding standard was automatically used in Eclipse, but we had never touched upon that in those classes. Coding standards were more of an afterthought.

ESLint in IntelliJ gave me a headache initially. I see how important it really is though. It keeps the code organized and helps other people understand your code much easier. ESLint also helps with looking out for mistakes that will keep your code from running.
