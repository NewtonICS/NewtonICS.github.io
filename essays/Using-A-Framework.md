The past couple weeks have been a grind in figuring out how Semantic UI works in HTML. The difficulty curve is definitely not on the level of learning a new language, but I still had to take time to learn the intricacies.

## Scouring the documentation.

Semantic UI has an easy-to-use website that contains all of the documentation for Semantic. I used that site for every single assignment these past weeks. I am really glad how easy it was to find the right documentation.

## Constantly needing to be overwritten.

I had to constantly keep changing the class of different divs since properties kept being changed by Semantic UI. This resulted in more time being invested than necessary. Things that should take a single minute took more than five.

I think that Semantic UI is a nice framework to use for building a website. It's rather easy all things considered.
