** Daily Routine
Waking up an hour and a half before my first class was my routine every semester. I would eat breakfast and take a shower before heading out. I normally go to my first class of the day, eat lunch, then attend the rest of my classes that day.
After the quarantine, I have stayed home all morning and afternoon. My evenings are spent mostly at the ITS Help Desk. I work all night helping teachers and students alike with adjusting to the new work environment. Work has been busy from start to finish everyday.
** My family
Luckily, my parents are able to work from home during this time. They both work for the government which has helped them with their job security.
They haven’t caught the virus yet (and hopefully will never). They only need to leave once every so often to shop for essentials. They only needed to use their hurricane supplies when people were initially buying out the entire store.
** My living situation
I live in an apartment near UH Manoa with two of my friends. My friends and I spent most of our time indoors, so adjusting our living to stay inside was not a hard task. What I worry about is that I accidentally bring back the virus from work and infect my roommates. I wash my hands whenever I come back from work or if I go out shopping. I avoid touching my face and tell my roommates to do the same (even if I sound annoying doing so).
** Learning online
I have taken online classes before, but usually one or two a semester at most. All of my classes transitioning online has me stressed like crazy. I learn the best when I am sitting in class listening to the teacher directly. It’s hard to motivate myself when it’s all online. This semester I will need to force myself to learn all of the materials from all of my classes online.
** The benefits
Moving away from the negativity, I have more free time now that I do not have to spend time walking to and from class. I have been able to put some time into my hobbies after finishing homework that I would have normally spent walking around.
