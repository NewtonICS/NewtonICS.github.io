## Project Idea: Manoa Open Parking

# Overview
*The problem:* Finding parking on campus can be tiresome. On campus parking is nearly impossible to find on a normal weekday. This means there is time wasted scouring the parking lots for a parking space when you could be walking to class already.

*The solution:* A site that allows students and faculty to know which parking spaces are open or taken. They will be able to input whether a space is open or taken as well. While taking data from the users can be less efficient and accurate, this would mean that no external hardware would need to be installed to check the parking stalls.

# Mockup page ideas
* Landing/Login page
* Create an account page
* Parking Spaces page
* User profile page
* Admin page

# Case ideas
* The landing page will ask the person to log in.
* If the user does not have an account, they can create one and be sent to a create account page.
* Once logged in, the parking spaces page will appear.
* The parking spaces page will show the campus with parking spaces.
* Taken parking spaces will be yellow, while open ones will be blue. (These colors are chosen to help colorblind people). There will be a legend to help as well.
* Clicking on a space will give options such as “Open” or “Taken”.
* There will be a user icon at the top right. Clicking it will take the user to their profile.
* The profile menu will show basic user information. It will also show a few statistics, such as how many times they have opened or closed a space.

# Beyond the basics
* Users can comment on a parking space to say that there is a pothole there, or that there are often cats nearby, etc.
* See a nickname of the person who last marked the parking spot.
