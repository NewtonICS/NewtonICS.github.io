## A real project

My past projects in computer science generally consisted of using Java to output to the console. I had a single project in ICS 111 that seemed a little more practical. The project was to create a game in Java that met specific requirements. The only problem is that the program was written in Java, which is definitely not made to create games. It did not feel like I was making something with a real world application.

The final project required by ICS 314 felt as though I was coding for a real application. We were given a problem that needed solved. We were required to make a website that gave those solutions.

## GitHub and issue branches

I have never used GitHub for a project before this one. To be fair, I have not worked in a proper group programming project before.

GitHub made everything so much easier. Issues were in their own branch. Testing new features were in their own branch. Everything different from the master was put into its own branch.

## My contributions

I assisted with the creation of the Study Spots page. This was headed by my good teammate Michael Chun, but I tinkered around with a few elements that ended up sticking in the final build.

I created the Edit Spot page which edited the spot selected. It brought in the previous data to help the user not make unwanted changes as well.

The other page I worked on was the My Study Spots page. This page listed the study spots that the user owns.

## Where can I find the project?

Here is a link to the project page: https://geostudy.github.io/. It will have instructions on how to install the project and its dependencies.
