summary: My first time making a pie turned out to be a success!
---
I have never baked once in my life by myself. I can help my parents chop up a few ingredients and mix some liquids together, but never created my own dish. That all changed when I decided to treat my parents to a nice pie.

I wanted to show my parents how much I appreciate their efforts for keeping me in school. So a pie should work fine, right? Well I had to find a recipe, so I took one from a famous Youtuber called "Binging with Babish". His recipe was simple to follow. I had to rewind the video a few times, but I got through it.

The pie came out a little ugly, but the taste was out of this world. My parents had brought over some guests and all of them only gave glowing reviews. I was stunned with my performance for this pie.
